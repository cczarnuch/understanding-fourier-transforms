# Understanding Fourier Transforms

This is a fourth year course project that uses the 'Design Thinking' process to
interview and develop a user interface for a problem that a group of people are having.

The group of people in this project are specifically students taking the introductory signals and systems
course in which they learn about Fourier Transforms. This application aims to help those struggling with
visualising Fourier Transforms by letting them choose simple functions and changing variables to see the
input and outut functions.
